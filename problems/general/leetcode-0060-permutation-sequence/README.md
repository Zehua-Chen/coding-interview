# 60. Permutation Sequence

The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for`n = 3`:

- "123"
- "132"
- "213"
- "231"
- "312"
- "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

# Contraints

- `1 <= n <= 9`
- `1 <= k <= n!`

# Examples

```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"
```
