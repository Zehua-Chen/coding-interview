**Intersection**
Given two singly linked list. Determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node.
Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the
first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as jth node of the second linked list, then
they are intersecting.
