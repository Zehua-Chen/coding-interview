# Cracking the Coding Interview 2.3

**Delete Middle Node**:
implement an algorithm to delte a node in the middle (any node but the first and last node, but

## Questions that Should be Asked

1. What happens if not middle? (Assume: do nothing)
    - End node is easy to detect
    - Can't detect if it is first node
