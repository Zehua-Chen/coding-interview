# Cracking the Coding Interview 1.3

**URLify**:
write a method to replace all spaces in string with a `%20`.

- You may assume that the string has enough spaces to hold the additional characters
- You are given to the true length of the string (ex. `a b` has length 3)

## Questions that Should be Asked

1. How about empty strings? Should I give a `%20`
2. How about consecutive white spaces?
