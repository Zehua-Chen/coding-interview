# Cracking the Coding Interview 1.4

**Palindrome Permutation**:
Given a string, determine if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase
that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome
does not need to be limited to just dictionary words

## Questions that Should be Asked

1. Is space included in the palindrome? (assumes no)
2. Case-sensitive? (assumes no)
3. Character encodings
