# Two Sum

Given an array of integers, find the indexes of two elements that will add to a given target

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same
  element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order.

```python
data = [2, 3, 4]
target = 5

result = find_sum(data, target)
print(result) // (0, 1)
```
