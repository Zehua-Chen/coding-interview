# Copy

**Coping/Overwriting can have the same effect as deleting**; given the node `2`
in `1->2->3`, **copy `3` to `2` give the same effect as deleting `2` from `1`**,
even though `1` is not available

# Greedy

You have to be able to spot that the problem can be decomposed into sub-problems
and that their optimal solution is part of the optimal solution of the whole
problem.

# Runner Technique

Two pointers, iterating through a list

- One travel slower
- One travel faster
