# Overview <span id="overview">

The content of this document supplements the contents of
[Coding Skills](CodkingSkills.pdf)

# Listening <span id="listening">

- Retain information about the questions. If a piece of information is not
  useful, it won't be in the question

# Examples <span id="examples">

- Give examples that are
  - **Specific**: examples should consist of real data
  - **Sufficiently large**: most examples are too small, by 50%
  - **Not a special case**: special case can be deceiving

# State a Brute Force <span id="state-a-brute-force">

- A brute force is a good starting points for discussion and optimization
- If you are stuck, you don't want the interviewer to think that you cannot find
  the easy solution

# Implement <span id="implement">

You need to demonstrate that you are a great developer

- **Modularized code**
- **Error check**: use a "TODO" or explain out loud to save time
- **Use classes/structs**
- **Good variable names**
  - Abbreviate long variable name after the first usage to save time

# Test <span id="test">

- **Conceptual test**: explain what each line does and see if it makes sense
- **Weird looking code**: double check code like `x = length - 2` or `i = 1`
- **Hot spots**: base cases, integer division, null nodes, start and end of a
  linked list, etc.
- **Small test case**
- **Special cases and edge cases**

Make sure to fix bugs in the best way possible.
